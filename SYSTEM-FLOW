To verify user login credentials (like admin / admin) and store them in a PostgreSQL database, you should implement a REST API to handle authentication. Here's how you can structure this:

📦 Step-by-Step Workflow
1.➡️Frontend (HTML Form) ➡️ 2. REST API (Express) ➡️ 3. Database (PostgreSQL)

🔌 REST API Workflow
1, Frontend Form submits the username and password via a POST request.
2, REST API (Node.js + Express) receives the request and checks the database.
3, If the credentials match (admin / admin), it responds with a success message.
4, If not, it responds with an error.
